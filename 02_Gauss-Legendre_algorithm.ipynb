It is notable for being rapidly convergent, with only 25 iterations producing 45 million correct digits of $\\pi$. However, the drawback is that it is computer memory-intensive and therefore sometimes Machin-like formulas are used instead.\n","\n","The method is based on the individual work of Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752–1833) combined with modern algorithms for multiplication and square roots. It repeatedly replaces two numbers by their arithmetic and geometric mean, in order to approximate their arithmetic-geometric mean.\n","\n","The version presented below is also known as the Gauss–Euler, Brent–Salamin (or Salamin–Brent) algorithm; it was independently discovered in 1975 by Richard Brent and Eugene Salamin. It was used to compute the first 206,158,430,000 decimal digits of $\\pi$ on September 18 to 20, 1999, and the results were checked with Borwein's algorithm."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"W55vyqKhYEvc","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Algorithm:\n","\n","1.
